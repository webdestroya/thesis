\section{Administrative Interface}
% - admin web server
% uses httprequesthandlers
% velocity templates
% based off phpBB admin interface
% has a few basic functions, and allows admins to administer those
% view connected clients
% update configuration values
% upload images
% execute specific commands
% perform backup
% restore backups
One of the last components to be added was the administrative interface. Calico now had a headless server, and we needed a way to remotely manage it. We decided against building the interface within the Calico client as we wanted to keep the client as lightweight as possible. 
Instead, we created a web-based interface that allows the Calico server to be managed through a web browser.

The administrative interface only provides basic management abilities. The core abilities it provides are:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep1pt

\item
\textbf{Easily modify settings}.
We needed the ability to modify the settings of an existing Calico server. We created a page that lists all the configuration variables and lets the administrator modify those values. When saved, the Calico server can then be restarted to reflect the configuration changes.

\item
\textbf{View currently connected clients}. 
This is helpful in the classroom environment to be able to see all users who are currently connected to the server. In the future we plan to add the ability to ``kick'' clients from the server, but this was never full developed.

\item
\textbf{Perform backup and restore of sessions}.
One of the major requirements was the ability to be able to generate a backup of an entire session. Our goal was to provide the administrator with the ability to create a backup file that represented the current state of the server. This file needed to contain all the data required to fully restore all canvases and any scraps, strokes, or arrows that may be contained in those canvases. Once a backup file is created, we needed a way for a server to restore such a backup. Our administrative interface provides this functionality through a form where a backup file can be selected and then uploaded directly to a running server. The server then reads the contents of this file and import all data into the server. Restoring a backup essentially wipes any existing content and recreates the entire session from scratch. Once a restore has been performed, clients can reconnect and they can see all the data, just as it was when the backup was created.

\end{itemize}

These few requirements were the driving force behind the administrative interface. It stands as a very barebones and minimalistic interface that provides functions that we decided were essential to operation. This administrative interface has proved invaluable when generating and restoring backups. Having a backup of sessions provides users with a greater level of reassurance that any work they have made will not be lost should anything happen to the server.

% list of website paths and each one is mapped to a request handler for that specific action

To keep the admin system lightweight, we decided to utilize the \texttt{HttpComponents} library provided by the Apache Foundation \cite{apache:http}. This library provides a single webserver endpoint that will route all web requests to a predefined list of request handler endpoints. These endpoints are specified in the \texttt{AdminRequestListenerThread} class within Calico. The most important part of this request handler is the ``request registry''. This registry acts as a routing engine that will route requests made to certain endpoints to a specific request handler designed to handle that request.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{code:request_registry} shows a code snippet of the routing table. The important part is the call to \texttt{reqistry.register}. In this snippet, you can see that any requests that are sent to \texttt{/gui/config/} will be sent to the \texttt{ConfigIndexRH} class to be processed. This allows us to break the administration system into logical components each designed to handle a different aspect of the server.

  \label{fig:admin_config}
\end{figure}

One example request handler is the \texttt{ConfigIndexRH} class that was mentioned above. This class is responsible for two separate tasks. The first task is to process a \texttt{GET} request to \texttt{/gui/config/} which means that the configuration form should be displayed in the user's browser (an example form can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:admin_config}). To create the HTML required for the administration interface, we decided to use a templating framework that allows us to write HTML that contained placeholders that could be rendered by the request handlers. The template framework that we chose to use was Apache's Velocity \cite{velocity} framework. We decided to use Velocity because of its ease-of-use as well as powerful language that allowed us to create various macros to easily abstract common interface elements. The interface look-and-feel was copied from the administrative interface of an open-source forum system, PhpBB \cite{phpbb}. Figure \ref{code:tpl_config} shows a snippet of the template language that was used to generate the configuration form seen in Figure \ref{fig:admin_config}.

\end{figure}

The second task of the configuration request handler was to process a \texttt{POST} request to the same endpoint. This request was for a form submission, which instructed the server to update the configuration settings on the server to reflect the values entered in the configuration form.

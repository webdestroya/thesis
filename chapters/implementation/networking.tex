% Intro parts
As a distributed and collaborative system, networking is a key part of Calico. The networking system must be able to support many clients at the same time, some of which may be working on the same canvas. The networking system in Calico consists of three major components: the main server socket and individual client process threads, the network queue processor, and the \texttt{CalicoPacket}. These three components work together to ensure that client requests are quickly handled, and that conflicts are properly managed.

% Socket/ClientThreads
The first component is the primary server socket and client threads. We decided to implement Calico as a TCP \cite{network} server in order to benefit from TCP's flow control and error correction. While TCP may be slower than UDP, the benefits of ensuring packets are received in the order they are sent as well as maintaining a continuous session outweighted any performance gains of UDP. When the Calico server is started, a TCP socket listener is created that waits for client connections to arrive. Upon receiving a new connection from a client, a new \texttt{ClientThread} is created that will then handle the connection with the client for the remainder of the client's session. By using a multi-threaded network system, we can easily maintain multiple sessions at the same time.

% ProcessQueue
The second component is the network queue processor, implemented as \texttt{ProcessQueue} class. This class is responsible for processing each packet that arrives from a client. When one of the \texttt{ClientThread}s receives a packet, the packet is then routed to the \texttt{ProcessQueue} which has a method for each packet type that can process that specific command. This class can then call any controllers as needed in order to complete the requested command.

% CalicoPacket
The \texttt{CalicoPacket} is responsible for encoding all information of a specific command into a byte array that can then be sent to clients. The packet is the lowest level of the networking system, but one of the most important. As noted in the previous section, the Calico packet was heavily based on Half-Life's network packet design. The first part of the packet contains a four-byte length which tells the system how far it needs to read in order to obtain the entire packet. By breaking commands down and transmitting them at the byte level, we were able to greatly reduce the network overhead that would be created if we had decided to send serialized objects over the network instead.

  \caption{An example STROKE\_LOAD packet}
\label{fig:stroke_packet}
\end{figure}


As an example, say a client has connected to the server for the first time. As soon as they join the server, the server will begin to notify them about all the elements that are visible on all canvases. An example of this would be the \texttt{STROKE\_LOAD} command which is used to notify a client about a stroke element. To notify the client, the server must create a \texttt{CalicoPacket} that can be sent to the client. The first part of the packet is the command ID. In this case, the command ID for \texttt{STROKE\_LOAD} is 230. The second, third, and fourth values are 64-bit integers used to denote the stroke's UUID, the UUID of the canvas that it belongs to, and the UUID of its parent element, respectively. The next three values are 32-bit integers used to denote the red, green, and blue values of the stroke's color. The next value is a 32-bit integer that indicates how many coordinates are used to describe the ``path'' of this stroke element. The remaining values are the actual coordinates used to describe the path. They are listed in x,y-pairs. A graphical version of this packet can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:stroke_packet}. This describes the logic required to generate a single \texttt{STROKE\_LOAD} command.

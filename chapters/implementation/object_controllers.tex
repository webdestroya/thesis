\section{Object Controllers}
In Calico the object controllers are responsible for handling all operations made on elements under their control. Each object type in Calico was provided with a controller.
Scraps, strokes, arrows, and canvases each have a controller that handles any interaction performed on the object. 
Controllers also act as the storage points for objects they are responsible for. This storage is discussed in the next section.

Controllers were created as static classes. This meant that each method in the controller would always be provided with the object's identifier, which it could then use to locate the object within the database. 
The controllers were also responsible for notifying the server of any changes that were performed. However, in order to prevent clients from sending notifications for actions that were not performed by the user, we created two types of functions for each action in the controller. The first function would perform the action and then notify the server, while a second function would perform the action without sending notifications. Any operation that was performed by the user would have a notification sent to the server. Any operation that was the result of receiving input from the server would not send a notification.

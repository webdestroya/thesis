\section{Object Controllers}
In Calico, object controllers are responsible for handling all operations made on elements under their control. Each object type in Calico is provided with a controller.
Scraps, strokes, arrows, and canvases each have a controller that handles any interaction performed on the object. 
Controllers also act as the storage points for the objects they are responsible for, as discussed in the previous section.

Controllers are created as static classes. This means that each method in the controller always is provided with the object's identifier, which it can then use to locate the object within the database. 
The controllers are also responsible for notifying the server of any changes that are performed. However, in order to prevent clients from sending notifications for actions that were not performed by the user, we created two types of functions for each action in the controller. The first function performs the action and then notifies the server, while a second function performs the action without sending notifications. Any operation that was performed by the user will lead to a notification sent to the server. Any operation that was the result of receiving input from the server will not send a notification.

Figure \ref{code:controller} shown above provides an excerpt of code from one of Calico's controllers. This example shows the basic operations that are available for the \texttt{StrokeController}. This controller is responsible for handling all ``stroke'' elements (line drawings). The controller is designed to be globally available backend that can be accessed by both the network connection (so that strokes can be created by the server) as well as by the input system (so strokes can be created using mouse events). 

Imagine the following scenario that we will use to describe how the Calico client would normally interact with the controller to create a sketched line on screen. In our example, we start with a blank \texttt{Canvas} screen, ready to begin sketching. The first event would be a \texttt{MouseEvent.MOUSE\_PRESSED} event that is sent to Calico's input handlers. The input handlers are responsible for ensuring that the user is in the proper mode (for sketching) and that the user is not clicking on a button. Once the input handler has determined that the user intends to sketch on screen, the event is handed off to the controller.

We first need to extract the \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} positions of the mouse coordinates from the \texttt{MouseInputEvent} object. The next step would be to obtain a new \texttt{uuid} for our stroke. This requires a call to \texttt{Calico.uuid()} which provides us with a new 64-bit integer that is unique across all clients. We now have all the information needed to start our stroke element, so execute a call to \texttt{StrokeController.start(uuid, canvasUUID, 0L, Color.RED)}. This creates a new stroke that is colored red, and has the provided \texttt{uuid}. 

Our stroke has been started, but at this moment there are no coordinates attached to the stroke. We will next need to call \texttt{StrokeController.append(uuid, xPos, yPos)} using the \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} positions of the mouse that we extracted in the previous paragraph. The call to \texttt{append} will repeat for every \texttt{MouseEvent.MOUSE\_DRAGGED}, until the \texttt{MouseEvent.MOUSE\_RELEASED} event is fired.

When the mouse has been released, Calico will make a call to the \texttt{StrokeController. finish(uuid)} method which signals that the user has finished drawing the stroke element, and it should be finalized. During the \texttt{finish} method, it ensures that the stroke is properly parented (if it is contained within a scrap, it will be added to that scrap).

During this process explained above, the client is sending events to the server (\texttt{STROKE\_START}, \texttt{STROKE\_APPEND}, \texttt{STROKE\_FINISH}). When the server receives these events, it performs an identical set of controller calls to record the sketching server-side. It will also mirror these commands to all connected clients. The benefit to using a global controller on the client is that when a stroke (or any element) is created by another user, the \texttt{CalicoPacket} can be easily mapped to the proper controller methods.

\thesisabstract
{
  Calico is a software-sketching tool that aims to support designers by helping them easily draft potential software systems. 
  Calico was designed to be used with a multi-touch whiteboard and projector so that it can replicate the role of a traditional whiteboard. 

  There are three main problems with Calico: 
  (1) distributed designers are not well supported, 
  (2) collaboration is not natively supported,
  and (3) it is very difficult to add new functionality.
  This thesis will examine these problems and present methods of resolving them:
  (1) creating a performance-based network architecture,
  (2) centering Calico around collaboration,
  and (3) creating a plugin framework to easily add new functionality.

  Prior to this work, Calico was unable to meet the demands of designers in the field. By resolving these problems, Calico was able to be deployed for classroom use as well as use by design teams.
